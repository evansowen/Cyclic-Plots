# Cyclic-Plots

Created an R script that will take a cyclic mechanical data set, identify the starting/ending points of each cycle,  determine the local minima/maxima associated with each mechanical cycle, parse the dataset,  export a ggplot object for each cycle and then use each plot object to produce an animated gif capable of affording a depiction of the evolution of mechanical stress as a function of cycle number. 

Mostly relied on for loops to automate all data reduction tasks.
